# 🏦 Credit Risk Prediction App

Predict the probability of a credit card customer defaulting next month using machine learning.

###  🚀 Live Demo

🔗 **Live App:** [Credit Risk Prediction App](https://creditriskpredictionapp.streamlit.app/)

### 📘 Overview

This project builds a machine learning pipeline to predict credit card default risk based on demographic, behavioral, and financial data.

The app allows users to input customer details (like credit limit, past payments, utilization rate, etc.) and get a real-time prediction of default probability.

### 🧠 Features

✅ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing (handled outliers, missing values)
✅ Feature Engineering (utilization ratio, average payment ratio)
✅ Model Training using XGBoost
✅ Hyperparameter Tuning to improve recall from 33% → 59%
✅ Deployment on Streamlit Cloud for live predictions
✅ Interactive UI with sliders and dropdowns
